    <p>To be honest, I'm not sure why I enrolled into this course. I wanted to study psychology, but everyone kept telling me it was a bad course to choose, so I cancelled my acceptance to Uottawa. But I didn't want to stay at home, so I decided to come to Algonquin. I was going to do cyber security right away, but it's just for graduates, so I chose to take web development first, and I'm really liking it.</p>
